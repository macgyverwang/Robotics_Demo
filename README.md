#Robotics_Demo

##Introduction:
The main purpose of this demonstration is to recognize color patches on the cars and ball, and find a path by A* algorithm in further.

##Procedure:
1. Recognizing color patches  
2. Creating map  
3. A* path finding  

Source code comprises one main code, robotics_demo.m, and three M-file functions.
